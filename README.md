# blockchain-voting-system
A decentralized electronic voting system using blockchain which helps users to cast their votes using the web portal in an efficient and secure manner. It is decentralized and distributed which means that there’s no central authority over the voting system. Technology Stack:

WORKING The voter must first login to the dapp using their Aadhar number and OTP confirmation. After authentication, the voter can now begin the process of voting. If the voter is valid then the voting pallete will be opened with candidate names. Now, the voter can cast their vote by clicking on the vote button next to their preferred candidate. A voter can cast their vote only once. After which, the voter’s automatically logged out. Same process continiues for many more votters irrespective of their voting wards. Vote count for each candidate is displayed on the portal, next to the candidate

ADVANTAGES No Voter’s ID required as a user's validity (age: 18+) is determined using the Aadhaar Reduced cost during election process Shorter wait times as it is decentralized A vote can be cast from anywhere in the country Highly scalable design Efficient election system in which the portal can be up for days together, in turn increasing voter turnout Portal’s frontend can be extended to provide additional useful information about the candidate thereby aiding voters in decision making (display promises, proposals etc.) TECHNOLOGY STACK: React.js Truffle Ganache Metamask Web3.js
